The objective of the assignment is to build a machine-learning model  that can predict the likelihood of a person having a heart disease based on the given features.

The heart CSV dataset contains 303 records and 14 columns, including the target variable. The features include:
Age (age), 
Gender (sex), 
Chest pain type (cp), 
Resting blood pressure (trestbps), 
Serum cholesterol (chol), 
Fasting blood sugar (fbs), 
Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg),
Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), 
Exercise-induced angina (exang), 
ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak), 
The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope), 
Number of major vessels colored by flourosopy (ca), and 
Thalassemia (thal).
